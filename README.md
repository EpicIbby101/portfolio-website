# portfolio-website

I declare that all of my work is my own. Some of the CSS used to create the grid for the projects was inspired by an exercise I have previously completed, which was code I wrote myself.

#Welcome to my Portfolio

As part of my bootcamp course, I'm required to build a portfolio showcasing my web development skills through the website itself as well as projects I show off on the site.
This portfolio is mostly minimalistic and responsive and is currently a work in progress, I will populate the website with more content as the course progresses.

Please find my portfolio here:
